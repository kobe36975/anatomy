- fracture of radius & ulna

    1. <span class="red">**Colles fracture**</span>: complete transverse fracture of the distal 2 cm of radius => the most common fracture of forearm
    > 發生於跌倒時手掌撐地 [color=red]
    2. dinner fork deformation: when Colles fracture, radius become shorter than ulna => ulnar styloid process avulse

- fracture of scaphoid
    :::spoiler <span class="dark-gray">*detail*</span>
    1. most frequently fracture of carpal bones
    2. result from a fall when hand is **abducted**
    3. pain is produced in anatomical snuff box, especially during wrist dorsiflextion & abduction(muscle of dorsal side contract)  
    4. **often misdiagnosed as severely sprained wrist**
    5. $\because$ poor blood supply $\therefore$ it takes at least 3 months to heal
    6. Avascular necrosis of proximal fragment of scaphoid may occur($\because$ inadequate blood supply) => produce degenerative joint disease

- fracture of hamate
    :::spoiler <span class="dark-gray">*detail*</span>
    1. $\because$ hypothenar muscle attaches to hook of hamate $\therefore$ fracture of hamate might cause nonunion of fractured bone
    2. it might hurt ulnar nerve & ulnar artery
